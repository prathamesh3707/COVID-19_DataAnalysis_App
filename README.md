# COVID-19_Data-Analysis_App
This app is developed using R and JavaScript. This real time web application shows COVID-19 Data and it is analysed in various aspects.

The home page shows worldwide total COVID-19 cases, total recoveries, deaths and affected countries. A map showing total cases per country and a tabular statistical report per country is also available. A simulation is also available which displays how COVID-19 emerged all across the world with real time graphical approach.

Two more ways of analyzing the data viz Graph and Tabular analysis are provided. The graphical analysis is much similar to that available on Aarogya Setu app. The tabular column set represents same data as shown by graph.

The dataset is taken from John Hopkins University and WHO site. The map, key figures, summary table and map simulation are done with the help of R Studio. Shiny library was used to run the dataset on web portal.
